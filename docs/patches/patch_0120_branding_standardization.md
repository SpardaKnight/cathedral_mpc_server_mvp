# Patch 0120: Branding Standardization

## Summary
- Updated the AnythingLLM Cathedral MPC Bridge plugin metadata to reflect the Warmaster author tag.
- Replaced legacy references to the personal name "Charles" with the standardized Warmaster branding across the codebase.
- Renamed hardware references mentioning the 5090 series to the "Windows Production Node" terminology.

## Rationale
Ensures the repository consistently reflects the Warmaster identity and standardizes infrastructure terminology across documentation and runtime metadata.
