# Patch 0008: Rename HA add-on folder for repository root discovery

## Summary
- rename the Home Assistant add-on directory to `cathedral_orchestrator/` at the repository root so the Add-on Store can index it directly
- update documentation references to point to the new `cathedral_orchestrator/` path layout

## Verification
- (per instructions) tests not run
