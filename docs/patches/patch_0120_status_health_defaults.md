# Patch 0120 â€“ Status payload shape, health readiness, auto-config defaults

## Summary
- Return model catalog as `{host_url: [model_id, ...]}` from `/api/status` per Cathedral v3.1 and document the contract.
- Tighten `/health` readiness so add-on reports `503` until LM clients are connected and at least one host is configured.
- Default `auto_config` to `true` across manifests and schema docs while keeping other locks/discovery flags `false`.
- Gate the Docker smoke test on CLI availability to keep test runs green when Docker is not installed.
